# Exploratory Data Analysis of Theme Park Reviews
_July 2022_

I conducted an EDA of theme park reviews of Universal Studios and Disneyland parks to understand how certain words and other variables were correlated with review scoring.

This report documents the process of cleaning and preparing the data using Python and Tableau Prep Builder, analyzing the data using Tableau, and a summary of the key findings and opportunities for future exploration.

Data used for visualization is included in the data folder.

Examples of the main charts and visualizations used for analysis are included in the dashboard document.

The project was carried out as follows:

-	Cleaned and prepared theme park reviews datasets with Tableau Prep Builder
-	Retrieved frequencies of word occurrences in reviews and categorized words based on other features of the dataset with Python
-	Designed visualizations to analyze theme park reviews, review sentiment, and word frequencies in Tableau
-	Compiled analysis, results, and ideas for further exploration in a report and presented key findings in a video presentation
